                While debugging, any changes to the razor page will need to the whole application to be re-built/re-run for changes to take effect. Change the project file so that you can make UI changes without restarting.

                Create a button on the page that increments a digit on the page (this should be a server side call, not Javascript (apart from any inbuilt ajax functions))

                Create a second page which can be accessed from the nav menu, the contents of the page should be a header that says "Number of clicks" with a paragraph that says "The button was pressed X times" (replacing X for how many times the button was pressed in question 2)

        <p>
            Here I modified 3 files HomeController,Index.cshtml and Program.cs
Added new functionality for setting the counter while we click the button. For capturing the counter I used session feature in controller.Intially set the session value into zero and each click it incremented one.Once it incremented put the counter value into aviewBag and send to view.
View page used this view bag value and display in the screen.
For adding session in the controller I made changes in program.cs file as well.

            <h3>Add your solution to question 3 here</h3>
            <p>
            Here I created new file in view named as Clicks.cshtml and display the view bag value under the text.This value we fetch from controller.
            For Navigating to the respective file I just added new nav link on the shared html file in layout folder.
